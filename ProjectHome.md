Realtime empirical mode decomposition implementation and Max/MSP object. The empirical mode decomposition algorithm is meant to break a signal into its "intrinsic mode functions": signals that are independent from each other. This shares some of the spirit of a Fourier transform in that it is separating a signal into its components, but unlike the Fourier transform it does not use such a readily identifiable feature such as pitch adjacency for identifying components.
